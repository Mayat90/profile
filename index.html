                <p>London. Olympics. 2012. Last jump...everybody is holding its breathes. We live a catastrophic scenario...Renaud, the front runner of the pole vault competition is in third position. 5.97 meters, nobody jumped that height during the games, but he did it. He did that last jump and flew over the bar, and my heart stopped. </p>

                <h3>The fall</h3>
                <p>We are about to win that f****** final. To get that f****** second star on our shirt. The italians are on their knees, it’s about time before we score that last goal. Few minutes before, Gianluigi saved his team from good header from Zidane. And the game stopped. Red card for Zidane…We don’t understand what’s going on before we saw the slow motion. The end of the game has no point anymore...we lost at this very moment, and everybody knows it.</p>

                <h3>So near and yet so far</h3>
                <p>Auckland, on 23rd october 2011. It's an anomaly, we don't deserve to be here. We don't even deserve to pass the groups. As always, the Blacks walked on every tournament. But France in rugby is inexplicable. New-Zealand knows it, and started to feel fear. And we start to play our first game of the tournament. The only game we deserved to win. Twist of irony.</p>
